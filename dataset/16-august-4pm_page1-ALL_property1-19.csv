Luxury 4-Bed, 3-Rec Detached Family Home Off Belmont Rd
A Modern Luxury Home in a Tranquil Setting
Nestled in a tranquil cul-de-sac off Belmont Road in Sharples, Bolton, this exquisite 4-bedroom, 3-bathroom, 3-reception room detached home is the epitome of modern luxury.
Meticulously renovated from top to bottom, no detail has been overlooked in this stunning transformation.
As you approach, the brand-new driveway and landscaped garden invite you in, with an impressive aluminium front door setting the tone for what lies beyond. Step inside to a breathtaking central stairway, crowned by a sparkling chandelier, where every inch of the home has been thoughtfully redesigned to showcase the finest finishes and cutting-edge technology.
A highlight of the home is the bespoke Venetian plasterwork, tailored by a specialist to complement each room, transforming the walls into a canvas of artistic expression. Every aspect of the property is brand new—from the meticulously crafted tiles to the bespoke kitchen and opulent bathrooms.
The home has been fully rewired to feature a state-of-the-art electrical system, seamlessly blending modern convenience with luxury. Most features can be controlled via smartphone, providing a contemporary, tech-savvy living experience. An efficient new boiler with a 12-year warranty ensures reliability, while underfloor heating spans the entire ground floor with individual zone controls for optimal comfort. This home truly embodies a perfect blend of artistry, innovation, and modern living.
Sophisticated Living Spaces
Step through the custom black door to your right and enter the elegantly designed lounge.
This space is the ultimate relaxation haven, featuring a built-in media wall with a luxurious bronzed polished plaster finish, complete with an inset electric fireplace, wall-mounted TV point, and recessed shelving on either side, all highlighted by spotlights above. The same striking marble flooring from the hallway continues seamlessly, creating a harmonious flow throughout the home.
A Designer Kitchen Beyond Compare
Spanning the rear of the home, the new kitchen exudes modern elegance, a space where sophistication meets functionality. Sunlight pours in through expansive sliding glass doors, illuminating the sleek, open-plan design and creating a seamless connection to the lush greenery outside.
At the heart of the room is a commanding island, draped in dark, veined marble that cascades in smooth waterfall edges. Around it, plush grey stools with gleaming gold bases invite conversation, blending comfort with opulence. Above, recessed LED lights sprinkle a soft, even glow, reflecting off glossy white floors that seem to stretch endlessly, amplifying the room's airy and luminous charm.
The cabinetry is a study in understated luxury. Its handleless design, swathed in dark marble with elegant gold accents, conceals integrated appliances including top-of-the-range Siemens appliances, including a coffee machine, two steam ovens, and a combi microwave. Every detail whispers refinement, from the clean, minimalist lines to the subtle interplay of textures. The kitchen’s polished surfaces and monochrome tones are balanced by the outdoors visible through floor-to-ceiling glass, inviting nature’s calm into the space. This is more than a kitchen—it’s a sanctuary of style, where culinary creativity and elegant living coexist effortlessly.
Striking Dual-Sided Fireplaces
Anchoring the kitchen and living spaces are dual linear electric fireplaces, each framed in a textured golden surround that exudes warmth and grandeur. Visible from both sides, these fireplaces create a stunning focal point, with their flickering flames reflecting the golden accents throughout the home. Above each fireplace, recessed alcoves provide ideal spaces for sleek televisions or statement art pieces, completing the sophisticated design.
New windows and doors, including sleek bifold doors leading to the private rear garden, enhance the seamless indoor-outdoor flow, perfect for both relaxation and entertaining. Phone-compatible spotlights throughout add an extra layer of modern convenience, allowing you to set the perfect lighting ambiance with just a tap. Every inch of this home has been meticulously crafted to offer a lifestyle of unparalleled elegance and contemporary comfort.
Versatile and Flexible Spaces
At the front of the ground floor, a third reception room presents a versatile space, perfectly suited as an additional sitting room, a playroom, or a private study for those working from home. Designed with flexibility in mind, this room adapts effortlessly to meet the needs of modern living.
All the bathrooms in the home, imported directly from Italy, are a true testament to luxury, showcasing the high-end Gessi brand. Thoughtfully designed for both style and practicality, each bathroom includes built-in storage and handy shelving, ensuring a seamless blend of elegance and functionality.
No expense spared even the downstairs guest wc is a vision of modern luxury. Polished white marble, veined with gold and grey, wraps the space in elegance, while a bold black vanity supports a copper basin that gleams like a jewel.
A circular backlit mirror casts a soft glow, its halo effect amplifying the drama. Slender copper pendants descend from a metallic-textured ceiling, echoing the basin’s warmth. The wall-mounted toilet, paired with a matte black flush plate, blends seamlessly into the minimalist design. Every detail, from hidden LED lighting to subtle accessories, whispers sophistication. A compact space transformed into a statement of artistry.
Luxurious Bedrooms and Bathrooms
Upstairs, soft silk carpet sweeps across the landing and into all four double bedrooms, wrapping the space in quiet luxury.
At the front, the main bedroom impresses with a sleek, integrated super-king LED bed—a perfect harmony of style and practicality. Neutral tones create a serene backdrop, while two windows, dressed with Venetian blinds, frame the view.
Step into the ensuite, where opulence awaits. Black and gold-veined marble tiles set the stage, highlighting a spacious double shower with LED-lit recesses. Contrasting white marble, a gold-accented vanity sink, and a WC complete this sophisticated retreat.
Bedroom two features a striking marble and copper-effect backdrop behind the bed, adding a touch of drama and elegance.
Its luxury ensuite continues the theme, boasting a grey marble-style counter topped with a sleek black bowl sink. A storage cupboard below offers practicality, while a double shower with LED-lit recesses and black fittings completes the space with a bold, modern edge.
Bedrooms three and four provide a neutral canvas, ready for your personal touch. Crisp white walls, soft grey carpeting, black skirtings, and wall-mounted radiators create a sleek, modern foundation.
One bedroom elevates the experience with a luxurious glass Juliet balcony, framing stunning views over Bolton—a perfect spot to soak in the scenery
The family bathroom is a haven of indulgence, featuring a freestanding bath paired with elegant copper floor-mounted taps. A provision for a tiled TV invites you to unwind in ultimate comfort.
Dual bowl sinks rest on a sleek black marble-style countertop, set against a polished wall backdrop and matching reflective ceiling. A spacious walk-in shower completes this luxurious retreat, blending style and relaxation seamlessly.
Indoor-Outdoor Living at Its Finest
Step outside and immerse yourself in a garden designed for enjoyment, day or night. In the summertime, open the expansive bifold doors to create a seamless flow between indoors and out, perfect for lively barbecues and relaxed entertaining.
The tiled patio stretches the full depth of the house, offering ample space for dining and lounging, while a sleek glazed balustrade adds a modern touch. Beyond, steps lead down to a lush, manicured lawn, providing a soft, open space for children to play and pets to roam freely. Fully enclosed for privacy and safety, this outdoor haven is as practical as it is inviting—a true extension of the home.
Prime Location for Modern Living
Tucked away off Belmont Road in the sought-after area of Sharples, this home enjoys the best of both worlds—situated on a peaceful residential estate while bordering the picturesque open countryside. It’s an ideal setting for those who cherish scenic walks and outdoor adventures right on their doorstep.
Families will appreciate the convenience of having High Lawns Primary School and Thornleigh Salesian College within easy walking distance. For leisure, local gems like The Wilton Arms pub and a variety of restaurants are close at hand, along with supermarkets and shops just minutes away by car.
Commuters will benefit from excellent transport links, with Bromley Cross and Hall i’th’ Wood train stations less than 1.5 miles away, offering seamless access to Manchester City Centre and beyond. This location truly combines tranquility with connectivity, making it a perfect place to call home.
