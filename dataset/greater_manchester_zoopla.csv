Luxury 4-Bed, 3-Rec Detached Family Home Off Belmont Rd
A Modern Luxury Home in a Tranquil Setting
Nestled in a tranquil cul-de-sac off Belmont Road in Sharples, Bolton, this exquisite 4-bedroom, 3-bathroom, 3-reception room detached home is the epitome of modern luxury.
Meticulously renovated from top to bottom, no detail has been overlooked in this stunning transformation.
As you approach, the brand-new driveway and landscaped garden invite you in, with an impressive aluminium front door setting the tone for what lies beyond. Step inside to a breathtaking central stairway, crowned by a sparkling chandelier, where every inch of the home has been thoughtfully redesigned to showcase the finest finishes and cutting-edge technology.
A highlight of the home is the bespoke Venetian plasterwork, tailored by a specialist to complement each room, transforming the walls into a canvas of artistic expression. Every aspect of the property is brand new—from the meticulously crafted tiles to the bespoke kitchen and opulent bathrooms.
The home has been fully rewired to feature a state-of-the-art electrical system, seamlessly blending modern convenience with luxury. Most features can be controlled via smartphone, providing a contemporary, tech-savvy living experience. An efficient new boiler with a 12-year warranty ensures reliability, while underfloor heating spans the entire ground floor with individual zone controls for optimal comfort. This home truly embodies a perfect blend of artistry, innovation, and modern living.
Sophisticated Living Spaces
Step through the custom black door to your right and enter the elegantly designed lounge.
This space is the ultimate relaxation haven, featuring a built-in media wall with a luxurious bronzed polished plaster finish, complete with an inset electric fireplace, wall-mounted TV point, and recessed shelving on either side, all highlighted by spotlights above. The same striking marble flooring from the hallway continues seamlessly, creating a harmonious flow throughout the home.
A Designer Kitchen Beyond Compare
Spanning the rear of the home, the new kitchen exudes modern elegance, a space where sophistication meets functionality. Sunlight pours in through expansive sliding glass doors, illuminating the sleek, open-plan design and creating a seamless connection to the lush greenery outside.
At the heart of the room is a commanding island, draped in dark, veined marble that cascades in smooth waterfall edges. Around it, plush grey stools with gleaming gold bases invite conversation, blending comfort with opulence. Above, recessed LED lights sprinkle a soft, even glow, reflecting off glossy white floors that seem to stretch endlessly, amplifying the room's airy and luminous charm.
The cabinetry is a study in understated luxury. Its handleless design, swathed in dark marble with elegant gold accents, conceals integrated appliances including top-of-the-range Siemens appliances, including a coffee machine, two steam ovens, and a combi microwave. Every detail whispers refinement, from the clean, minimalist lines to the subtle interplay of textures. The kitchen’s polished surfaces and monochrome tones are balanced by the outdoors visible through floor-to-ceiling glass, inviting nature’s calm into the space. This is more than a kitchen—it’s a sanctuary of style, where culinary creativity and elegant living coexist effortlessly.
Striking Dual-Sided Fireplaces
Anchoring the kitchen and living spaces are dual linear electric fireplaces, each framed in a textured golden surround that exudes warmth and grandeur. Visible from both sides, these fireplaces create a stunning focal point, with their flickering flames reflecting the golden accents throughout the home. Above each fireplace, recessed alcoves provide ideal spaces for sleek televisions or statement art pieces, completing the sophisticated design.
New windows and doors, including sleek bifold doors leading to the private rear garden, enhance the seamless indoor-outdoor flow, perfect for both relaxation and entertaining. Phone-compatible spotlights throughout add an extra layer of modern convenience, allowing you to set the perfect lighting ambiance with just a tap. Every inch of this home has been meticulously crafted to offer a lifestyle of unparalleled elegance and contemporary comfort.
Versatile and Flexible Spaces
At the front of the ground floor, a third reception room presents a versatile space, perfectly suited as an additional sitting room, a playroom, or a private study for those working from home. Designed with flexibility in mind, this room adapts effortlessly to meet the needs of modern living.
All the bathrooms in the home, imported directly from Italy, are a true testament to luxury, showcasing the high-end Gessi brand. Thoughtfully designed for both style and practicality, each bathroom includes built-in storage and handy shelving, ensuring a seamless blend of elegance and functionality.
No expense spared even the downstairs guest wc is a vision of modern luxury. Polished white marble, veined with gold and grey, wraps the space in elegance, while a bold black vanity supports a copper basin that gleams like a jewel.
A circular backlit mirror casts a soft glow, its halo effect amplifying the drama. Slender copper pendants descend from a metallic-textured ceiling, echoing the basin’s warmth. The wall-mounted toilet, paired with a matte black flush plate, blends seamlessly into the minimalist design. Every detail, from hidden LED lighting to subtle accessories, whispers sophistication. A compact space transformed into a statement of artistry.
Luxurious Bedrooms and Bathrooms
Upstairs, soft silk carpet sweeps across the landing and into all four double bedrooms, wrapping the space in quiet luxury.
At the front, the main bedroom impresses with a sleek, integrated super-king LED bed—a perfect harmony of style and practicality. Neutral tones create a serene backdrop, while two windows, dressed with Venetian blinds, frame the view.
Step into the ensuite, where opulence awaits. Black and gold-veined marble tiles set the stage, highlighting a spacious double shower with LED-lit recesses. Contrasting white marble, a gold-accented vanity sink, and a WC complete this sophisticated retreat.
Bedroom two features a striking marble and copper-effect backdrop behind the bed, adding a touch of drama and elegance.
Its luxury ensuite continues the theme, boasting a grey marble-style counter topped with a sleek black bowl sink. A storage cupboard below offers practicality, while a double shower with LED-lit recesses and black fittings completes the space with a bold, modern edge.
Bedrooms three and four provide a neutral canvas, ready for your personal touch. Crisp white walls, soft grey carpeting, black skirtings, and wall-mounted radiators create a sleek, modern foundation.
One bedroom elevates the experience with a luxurious glass Juliet balcony, framing stunning views over Bolton—a perfect spot to soak in the scenery
The family bathroom is a haven of indulgence, featuring a freestanding bath paired with elegant copper floor-mounted taps. A provision for a tiled TV invites you to unwind in ultimate comfort.
Dual bowl sinks rest on a sleek black marble-style countertop, set against a polished wall backdrop and matching reflective ceiling. A spacious walk-in shower completes this luxurious retreat, blending style and relaxation seamlessly.
Indoor-Outdoor Living at Its Finest
Step outside and immerse yourself in a garden designed for enjoyment, day or night. In the summertime, open the expansive bifold doors to create a seamless flow between indoors and out, perfect for lively barbecues and relaxed entertaining.
The tiled patio stretches the full depth of the house, offering ample space for dining and lounging, while a sleek glazed balustrade adds a modern touch. Beyond, steps lead down to a lush, manicured lawn, providing a soft, open space for children to play and pets to roam freely. Fully enclosed for privacy and safety, this outdoor haven is as practical as it is inviting—a true extension of the home.
Prime Location for Modern Living
Tucked away off Belmont Road in the sought-after area of Sharples, this home enjoys the best of both worlds—situated on a peaceful residential estate while bordering the picturesque open countryside. It’s an ideal setting for those who cherish scenic walks and outdoor adventures right on their doorstep.
Families will appreciate the convenience of having High Lawns Primary School and Thornleigh Salesian College within easy walking distance. For leisure, local gems like The Wilton Arms pub and a variety of restaurants are close at hand, along with supermarkets and shops just minutes away by car.
Commuters will benefit from excellent transport links, with Bromley Cross and Hall i’th’ Wood train stations less than 1.5 miles away, offering seamless access to Manchester City Centre and beyond. This location truly combines tranquility with connectivity, making it a perfect place to call home.

No onward chain
A traditional garden fronted freehold property situated in a cul-de-sac location just off Manchester Road in Bury only a short walk to the town centre and all amenities and the Metrolink station. The property has been in the same ownership for the last six decades and of course in that time certain upgrades have been carried out to include combination gas central heating, upvc double glazing and a recently installed bathroom suite. It is prudent to suggest that a new owner will want to carry out further modernisation works to bring the property up to current day standards, however the property provides excellent potential for a new buyer to personalise the accommodation to their own tastes. Briefly the accommodation comprises: Entrance vestibule, inner hall, lounge with living flame fire, sitting room again with living flame fire, kitchen, first floor landing two double bedrooms and a recently installed bathroom with shower. To the outside there are well stocked garden areas to the front and rear.

Potential for further extension
This property has much to offer and has been very thoughtfully renovated both inside and out.
We would anticipate that many potential buyers will see the X Factor of this home as the large rear garden which has been thoughtfully landscaped and includes a number of outbuildings. Additionally, there is a long private driveway and front garden. This plot size would allow scope for further extension yet still allow the home to retain a large garden.
The accommodation has been reconfigured internally and includes a good sized entrance hall with access to a large ground floor storeroom which has been prepared to accommodate a ground floor WC.
There are two living areas both with access to a stunning modern open plan kitchen. To the first floor there are three double bedroom served by an impressive modern bathroom and please note there is also a large loft with two roof lights and the size should allow scope for conversion should this be of interest.
The sellers have expended a lot of time in maintaining the property which over recent years has seen the bathroom refurbished, new central heating radiators throughout, pointing to the front and rear of the property and an Indian stone patio being laid to the rear garden.
Early viewing is highly recommended to appreciate what this property has to offer.
The property is Freehold
Council Tax is Band A - £1,531.45
Located close to Chorley New Road in Horwich we find that many people look to settle within this area due to the convenient location as amenities such as key motorway and train links are around 1.5 miles away and there is also access to a great variety of shops and services at the nearby Middlebrook retail development.
Popular primary and secondary schools serve the area and the town in general boasts excellent access to pleasant countryside.

Just a short stroll from a range of village amenities and glorious countryside walks, it’s a home that offers the very best of both worlds — heritage charm and modern practicality.
Spanning three floors, the generous accommodation includes a spacious entrance hallway, large open-plan kitchen and dining room flowing onto the garden, two further substantial reception rooms, utility, downstairs WC, five bedrooms, two bathrooms and a storeroom. Outside, a private driveway, secluded sunny rear garden, and a versatile detached garden room complete the package.
Period Character & Charm
From the moment you step through the original oak front door, the home’s heritage is evident. The hallway retains beautiful oak panelling and staircase, enhanced by statement tiled flooring. Period features continue throughout, from picture rails to open fires with cast iron surrounds, all set against a premium Farrow & Ball colour palette. The current owners have done a superb job of preserving this charm while subtly upgrading the property to meet modern living standards.
Open-Plan Living
The showpiece of this home is the stunning open-plan kitchen and dining space created by the recent extension. A soaring vaulted ceiling, skylights, and French doors fill the room with natural light and create a seamless connection to the garden — ideal for relaxed summer living and entertaining.
The walnut breakfast bar invites Sunday brunches, while the quartz worktops and minimalist cabinetry keep the look sleek and timeless. A suite of Neff integrated appliances includes a dishwasher, oven and combination oven, five-zone induction hob with extractor, plus full-height fridge and freezer. Whether it’s hosting friends for dinner or enjoying busy family life, this is a space that works beautifully day to day.
Reception Rooms
Two further reception rooms offer flexibility for family life. The rear room opens onto the patio, making a wonderful summer lounge, while the bay-fronted room to the front is perfect for cosy winter evenings by the fire. Both feature traditional chimney breasts and open fireplaces, keeping the home’s character alive.
Practical Spaces
The utility room mirrors the kitchen’s modern styling, with extra worktops, storage, and plumbing for laundry appliances. An external door makes it ideal as a secondary entrance for muddy boots and dogs.
Bedrooms & Bathrooms
Across the first and second floors are five well-proportioned bedrooms, four of which are generous doubles. The fifth, currently used as a home office, enjoys far-reaching views towards Manchester.
On the first floor, the front bedroom boasts a charming mullion window, while the rear enjoys a bay with green garden views. The family bathroom is equally impressive, with a freestanding bath, walk-in shower, basin, and WC set against coordinating wall and floor tiles.
The second floor is perfect for a teenager or guest suite, with a spacious double bedroom under sloped ceilings and skylights, plus an adjacent shower room with a modern three-piece suite.
Outside Space
To the front, a large driveway with EV charging point is framed by mature planting, giving excellent kerb appeal. The south-westerly rear garden is a true suntrap from midday to evening, with two patios — one for al-fresco dining, the other for lounging — plus a central lawn, mature borders, and fruit and vegetable planters for green-fingered buyers.
The detached garden studio, complete with power, lighting, and hot/cold water, is an adaptable space for a home office, gym, bar, or hobby room.
Location
Holcombe Brook is one of Ramsbottom’s most desirable areas, offering a warm village feel with the convenience of excellent local amenities. Within walking distance you’ll find independent shops, cafés, cocktail bars, country pubs and restaurants, along with everyday essentials such as supermarkets and healthcare facilities.

The ground floor also boasts a well-equipped kitchen and breakfast area, complete with premium appliances, which connects to a separate, self-contained annex. This additional living space includes a second kitchen, bathroom, lounge and a double bedroom — ideal for extended family or guests. The annex is easily separated / combined into the main residence with two lockable internal doors.
A stylish garden room at the rear of the property overlooks the garden, while a convenient downstairs WC completes the ground floor.
Upstairs, the traditional landing leads to five large bedrooms. The standout master suite features a duplex design, with a spiral staircase leading to a private upper level that includes a lounge (with ideal work from home office space), bathroom featuring twin bathtubs, and separate shower room — perfect for modern living.
A spacious family bathroom, a Jack & Jill shower room, and an en-suite to one of the bedrooms ensure convenience and comfort for all.
For added versatility, the property includes a large basement divided into three rooms — offering excellent potential for conversion into games / entertainment spaces or an additional self-contained living space.

Hale village on the other hand meets the needs of its local residents with butchers, bakers, coffee shops and convenience stores.

Recently upgraded with a brand-new kitchen and new roof in 2024, it combines modern comfort with stunning panoramic views over open countryside. Perfectly suited for family life, the layout includes a welcoming entrance hall, full-depth living room, spacious open-plan kitchen/dining room, home office, conservatory/utility, three bedrooms, and a family bathroom. Outside, the garage and under-garage basement provide exceptional storage, while the south-westerly garden captures the sun all afternoon through to spectacular sunsets.
Living Space
Step inside to a generous entrance hall with plenty of space for coats, shoes, and everyday essentials, keeping the rest of the home clutter-free.
On the upper ground floor, the full-length living room offers a rare sense of scale, with large windows at both ends filling the room with natural light. From the rear, the window perfectly frames those breathtaking countryside views. The space is styled with a contemporary finish, complemented by a traditional chimney breast, oak mantel, and decorative inlet for added charm.
Also on this level, a dedicated home office/study provides a quiet corner to work or focus, away from the busier heart of the home.
On the lower ground floor, the impressive open-plan kitchen and dining room is the social hub, complete with underfloor heating for year-round comfort. The kitchen’s timeless yet modern design features integrated appliances, including a double oven, microwave, fridge-freezer, dishwasher, and a four-ring hob with concealed extractor. The breakfast bar seats four, while the spacious dining area is perfect for family meals and entertaining guests. The room flows into the conservatory/utility, leading directly out to the garden for easy indoor-outdoor living.
Bedrooms & Bathroom
Upstairs, three well-proportioned bedrooms make the most of the home’s elevated position, with the rear bedrooms enjoying those same incredible scenic views. The family bathroom offers a blank canvas for a modern update to your own taste and style.
Outside Space
To the front, a private drive and garage provide easy parking, with the garage basement adding valuable extra storage.
The rear garden is a great highlight, south-westerly facing to catch the sun from midday until evening, with a raised decking area for relaxing, dining, and entertaining against the backdrop of breathtaking sunsets over Winter Hill. Below, the lawn offers space for children to play or for green-fingered owners to create their ideal garden retreat.
Location
Despite the peaceful, elevated setting, you’re just moments from the heart of Egerton village and only a short drive to Bromley Cross. Both offer an excellent choice of pubs, restaurants, shops, and highly regarded schools and nurseries.
For outdoor lovers, the surrounding countryside, reservoirs, and West Pennine Moors provide endless opportunities for walking, cycling, running, and sailing.
Commuters benefit from quick access to the A666 for motorway connections, while Bromley Cross Train Station — around five minutes’ drive — offers direct services into central Manchester.

Edwardian residence
An elite style of presentation
Four receptions
Meticulous gardens
Gated sweeping driveway
Exquisite kitchen

Three bathrooms
Exceptional and large gardens
A beautifully imposing Edwardian detached residence, magnificently set within its own grounds, and quite possibly being one of the finest homes within the area.
The Old Vicarage is nicely nestled at the end of St Barnabas Drive with meticulously prepared gardens, gated sweeping driveway and a 'tip of the hat' to some amazing views of the local and surrounding countryside.
This is undoubtedly a gorgeous family home, where perhaps anyone who has business in Manchester or indeed Leeds, can easily 'return home' to a place that sits within the countryside and yet boasts a positioning that enjoys a convenient connection to the highly desirable centre of Littleborough Village where boutique clothes and coffee shops await. The countryside is also quite literally on the doorstep making a quick escape into the hills very easy indeed, and if commuting is your thing, the train links from here are superb.
This enigmatic dwelling has a style and an elite quality that seems to lavishly exude from everywhere and it is clearly evident that every detail from 'décor' to 'flow' has been immensely and professionally considered.
A brief insight into this exceptional and individual home further includes:
Ground floor – As you enter the property the large vestibule with original doors and ornate windows instantly welcomes you. There is a traditional cloaks room to the side. The reception hall has a returning stair case with a spindled balustrade to the first floor gallery style landing. The receptions are perfectly designed and decorated to enhance a function for each room as each one echoes its own personality. The study is already set for business as you will see. The sitting room is somewhere to put your feet up, and enjoy the roaring fire. The day lounge is again a place where the family may gather to catch up after the evening meal, still enjoying the sumptuous theme and with perhaps a more modern flair. From this lounge is access into the sun room with bi-folding doors, which is perfect if you are entertaining or is just the best place for an early morning coffee. The breakfast kitchen which is accessed from the hall and the sun room, is beautifully fitted with a breath taking selection of wall and base units, in-built appliances and matching Corian work surfaces. From here is access into the Utility and Laundry Room and personal access into the large double garage. Within here is a separate gym and a separate w.c.
First floor – the spacious and light galleried landing leads very nicely into each of the five double bedrooms and the two family bathrooms. As with the ground floor every detail has certainly been brushed with a professional eye. The Master Bedroom has been tastefully fitted with an exceptional level of quality furniture with a window seat to the bay. Bedroom number two enjoys its own en-suite bathroom and the house bathroom comprises of a luxury four piece suite. The guest bathroom is slightly smaller and still enjoys a sumptuous three piece suite.
Externally – at the front is the gravelled sweeping driveway with electronic security gated entrance. The gardens are meticulous and range from the traditional lawn with mature shrubbery borders, to a Zen style area. There is composite decking just from the garden room that currently leads to the large hot tub.
Please note the property has solar panels and our client informs that there is a saving of approximately £2,500 per year.

To the front, the mature and substantial enclosed garden benefits from both lawn and patio areas, including a multitude of shrubs and plants ensuring almost year-round colour. A growers paradise, the vegetable garden features a variety of plants, herbs and fruit trees, including gooseberry & blueberry bushes, apple & pear trees, rhubarb, strawberries and lemon balm. The owners have also been able to grow a wide variety of herbs and vegetables in the raised beds, including brassicas, pulses, garlic, onions and potatoes, whilst using a greenhouse to produce tomatoes, coriander and other herbs.
Delph Lodge can be located just off Huddersfield Road on the fringes of the popular village of Delph in Saddleworth. With trendy pubs, cafés and wine bars within walking distance, the property is also ideal for easy access to neighbouring villages including Dobcross, Diggle and Uppermill and as such, this would prove an ideal choice.

Bowness Road runs off Wood Street in Middleton, just around a mile from the town centre and approximately 5 minutes' drive from the M60/M62. The property is also well placed for access to Manchester, Rochdale, Bury, Oldham and Heywood centres.

Situated just off Milnrow Road (A663) close to the junction with Buckstones Road - a location which has proved consistently popular. On the doorstep of stunning countryside such as Crompton Moor, yet within easy reach of Shaw town centre, the property is also well placed for popular local schools and provides easy access to the M62 to Leeds. Saddlewoth is also not far away, Shaw & Crompton Metrolink station is within walking distance providing easy access to Manchester.

Stamp Duty
Residential property rates
You usually pay Stamp Duty Land Tax (sdlt) on increasing portions of the property price when you buy residential property, for example a house or flat.
The amount you pay depends on:
• when you bought the property
• how much you paid for it
• whether you’re eligible for relief or an exemption
Rates for a single property
You pay sdlt at these rates if, after buying the property, it is the only residential property you own.
You will usually pay 5% on top of these rates if you own another residential property.
Rates from 1 April 2025
Property or lease premium or transfer value sdlt rate
Up to £125,000 Zero
The next £125,000 (the portion from £125,001 to £250,000) 2%
The next £675,000 (the portion from £250,001 to £925,000) 5%
The next £575,000 (the portion from £925,001 to £1.5 million) 10%
The remaining amount (the portion above £1.5 million) 12%
Example
In April 2025 you buy a house for £295,000. The sdlt you owe will be calculated as follows:
• 0% on the first £125,000 = £0
• 2% on the second £125,000 = £2,500
• 5% on the final £45,000 = £2,250
• total sdlt = £4,750

Upon entering the home, you are welcomed by a bright hallway that showcases the original internal doors and staircase, giving a warm and characterful first impression.

Elevated above a tranquil wooded valley with landscaped gardens cascading down to the river below, this magnificent home offers unrivalled privacy, awe-inspiring design, and a standard of living that must be seen to be fully appreciated.
From the tree-lined driveway and bold architectural form to the exquisite interiors, bedroom suites, designer kitchen, multiple reception rooms, home cinema, indoor swimming pool and home gym — this is family life at its most refined. Located just moments from the amenities of Standish village, acclaimed schools, and key transport links, The Pump House is a home that delivers the very best of both worlds.
An Impressive Approach
The house is so discreetly positioned that if nobody told you it was here, you’d never know it existed. Accessed via electric gates, a tree-lined driveway opens to landscaped grounds and reveals the home in all its grandeur — perfectly framed by lush greenery and manicured lawns.
The main parking area is large enough for a whole fleet of cars, and the home welcomes you inside through a supersize bespoke solid oak door with glass surrounds, giving you the first impression of the grand proportions found throughout. A handy porch leads through to the central reception hall where you immediately notice the stylish oak and glass staircase, plus the abundance of natural light pouring in through the huge skylight window and glass wall at the rear.
The Designer Kitchen
The heart of the home is the exceptional designer kitchen and daily dining area — a breathtaking space with plentiful glass and panoramic views of the gardens and valley below. Bifold doors and three sets of French doors open onto a vast elevated composite deck, creating seamless indoor-outdoor living.
Designed and installed by the renowned Stuart Frazer, this premium Siematic kitchen features minimalist cabinetry, ambient recessed lighting, and deep Corian worktops. Every detail has been considered — from the walk-in pantry to the well-tailored storage and integral larder cabinets.
A selection of Miele appliances includes two conventional ovens with warming drawers, a microwave, steam oven, full-length fridge and dishwasher. Additional highlights include a Bora induction hob with built-in downdraft extractor, a Quooker tap with instant boiling, chilled and sparkling water, a Liebherr full-length freezer, and twin Monogram wine fridges.
At the centre is an enormous island with a contrasting dark oak breakfast bar — a stunning and practical hub for everyday family life, relaxed weekends, or entertaining. Whether it's Sunday brunch, evening drinks with friends, or summer barbecues spilling out onto the decking, this space is made to be enjoyed.
Reception Rooms
The Pump House offers four distinct reception rooms, each delivering space, comfort, and flexibility for the modern family.
The main lounge is a showstopper — around 33 sq m in size, with a vaulted double-height ceiling, six-panel bifold doors, and a stylish glass inset log burner within a towering chimney breast and gallery landing above. It’s a room made for hosting on a grand scale or unwinding in total comfort.
Next door, the media room offers another luxurious lounge experience, with floor-to-ceiling windows by day and a full cinema set-up by night — blackout blinds, projector screen, and surround sound at the touch of a button. It’s ideal as a cinema, games room or teenage retreat.
On the opposite side of the reception hall, the formal dining room enjoys an abundance of natural light, with French doors opening onto a covered al-fresco dining terrace. Perfect for dinner parties and special occasions, it blends elegance with atmosphere.
Adjoining the kitchen is a peaceful day lounge — currently a relaxed sitting room with more French doors onto the garden. It’s the perfect spot for morning coffee, a children's playroom, or a snug for reading and relaxation.
Practical Aspects
Functionality is fully considered, with a separate plant room, utility, guest WC, ample cloak storage, and a large, fully equipped home office designed for two people. A unique bonus is the first-floor laundry room — located near the bedrooms and complete with plumbing, sink, and generous storage.
Bedrooms & Bathrooms
The entire first floor benefits from vaulted ceilings and striking architectural lines. Full-height apex windows and walls of glass frame tranquil green views from every room.
Each of the five double bedrooms has its own sleek three-piece en-suite with tiled surrounds and modern fittings, all immaculately maintained. The master suite adds a walk-in dressing room and a stunning private balcony beneath an apex roof — your own peaceful morning sanctuary just steps from the bed.
Leisure Facilities
The indoor swimming pool is a standout feature, newly refurbished and upgraded with a Calorex system in 2025. Enjoy year-round heated swimming with a swim-jet system for endless laps, plus a hot tub, skylights, floor-to-ceiling windows, and bifold doors connecting you back to the neighbouring nature.
Accessed via a covered walkway from the house and also from the first floor via a spiral staircase, it’s a true private spa experience. A home gym links the gallery landing to the pool hall — equally suited to yoga or conversion into a wellness suite or sauna.
A Luxury Finish
From the moment you enter, the luxury is unmistakable — bespoke oak joinery and flooring, natural stone tiling, gallery landings, vast proportions, and world-class appliances throughout.
A Control4 smart home system allows you to manage lighting, heating, and audio from your phone, delivering comfort and convenience with every touch.
Gardens, Grounds & Garages
Set on approximately 4.5 acres with no neighbours in sight, this is more than a home — it's a countryside retreat. The gated driveway delivers complete seclusion and leads to a shale-surfaced parking area, triple garage, and carport with EV charging point.
To the rear, a full-width composite deck with glass balustrades offers a breath-taking entertaining space overlooking the valley and river. It’s piled into the ground for structural integrity and generously sized to accommodate sun loungers, dining zones, or even an outdoor kitchen if desired.
The surrounding grounds include manicured lawns, landscaped borders, rockeries, and mature trees. To one side, Japanese-inspired tiered lawns step down to a large wildlife pond, offering a magical connection to the river and nature. A children’s treehouse completes the picture — making this a truly special home for every generation.
Location
Despite its extraordinary privacy, The Pump House is just moments from the bustling and sought-after village of Standish — home to a wide selection of independent shops, cafes, restaurants, gyms, supermarkets, and top-rated schools.
The M6 motorway is a short drive away, placing Manchester, Preston, and the wider North West within easy commuting distance. This rare combination of peace, privacy, and connectivity makes the location just as impressive as the home itself.

Two staircases complete with brass hand rails provide access to the lower ground floor where there is a large family cinema room complete with stylish bar area, a games room, gymnasium, small utility area and WC. The vendors have cleverly retained and exposed some of the original brickwork in the hallway as a feature and all rooms have their own access to the terrace and gardens beyond.
To the first floor, the principal suite is generously sized, offering stylish fitted wardrobes housed in a separate dressing area, and a sizeable en-suite with freestanding tub, shower and marble topped sink unit. The bedroom has the benefit of a lovely sit on balcony overlooking the gardens below. The first floor is completed by a further three bedrooms all of which are doubles, serviced by a large family bathroom.

Outside, the property benefits from a newly laid large patio area, creating the perfect setting for entertaining, and a very private garden with ample space for outdoor fun with family and friends. The front garden adds further curb appeal.

Important Information For Successful Buyers:
We are required by law to conduct anti-money laundering checks on all those buying a property. Whilst we retain responsibility for ensuring checks and any ongoing monitoring are carried out correctly, the initial checks are carried out on our behalf by Lifetime Legal who will contact you once you have had an offer accepted on a property you wish to buy. The cost of these checks is £65 (incl. VAT), which covers the cost of obtaining relevant data and any manual checks and monitoring which might be required. This fee will need to be paid by you in advance of us issuing a memorandum of sale, directly to Lifetime Legal, and is non-refundable. We will receive some of the fee taken by Lifetime Legal to compensate for its role in the provision of these checks.

Spacious 4-Bedroom Stone Farmhouse In A Idyllic Rural Edgworth Setting
Birches Farm Cottage – A Most Unique Setting
Tucked just off Bury Road, close to the picturesque village of Edgworth, Birches Farm Cottage is a honey-hued semi-detached stone farmhouse where timeless character meets modern living. Framed by open countryside, its glass-roofed conservatory captures sweeping views across rolling fields, while the gardens – a blend of manicured lawns, vibrant borders, and stone pathways – offer peaceful corners to pause and take in the surroundings.
The approach sets the scene. A gentle climb along a farm track, edged with open green fields and drystone walls, draws you deeper into rural life. Passing through the working farmyard, the air carries the scent of hay and the occasional sound of livestock, a reminder of the home’s agricultural setting. Beyond the old stone gateposts and cattle grid, the paved driveway and integral double garage mark your arrival at this welcoming home.
Where Character Meets Comfort
Step inside the covered portico entrance into a bright, contemporary hallway, complete with a handy cloakroom cupboard and direct access to the garage. The warmth of the timber front door, the herringbone flooring, and the overall light and airy feel immediately set the tone – this is a home that respects its heritage while embracing a stylish, modern finish.
A Lounge for All Seasons
To the left lies the award-winning, magazine-featured lounge – a showpiece of style and comfort. A rustic double-sided stone fireplace with wood-burning stove anchors one wall, adding warmth and character. Soft recessed lighting casts a gentle glow over white walls, oak doors, and the stone-flagged floor that flows throughout the ground floor. Generous picture windows frame the surrounding greenery, creating a connection with the outdoors, while the spacious layout offers the flexibility for cosy evenings or larger gatherings. Integrated ceiling speakers in both the lounge and the kitchen enhance everyday living and entertaining, offering seamless, high-quality audio throughout the social heart of the home
Dining with a Sense of Occasion
The dining room is full of character, with flagstone flooring under centuries-old oak beams. The double-sided fireplace forms a striking focal point, perfect for lingering over candlelit dinners. A wide picture window overlooks the garden, bringing the changing seasons into every mealtime. Above, the double-height section reveals the oak staircase, complete with cleverly integrated storage beneath, linking the two floors with light and openness.
The Heart of the Home – Kitchen & Conservatory
The kitchen/breakfast room is designed to be both functional and inviting. Soft grey cabinetry with brushed brass handles pairs with warm wood worktops, while a range-style cooker sits beneath a concealed extractor, framed by rustic herringbone tiling. Integrated appliances include an oven, microwave, fridge, freezer, dishwasher, wine cooler, and a farmhouse-style sink perfectly placed beneath a window to take in the countryside views.
A breakfast bar seating four creates the ideal spot for casual dining, morning coffee, or catching up with friends. From here, a door opens to the conservatory – a light-filled space with glass walls and a vaulted roof that blurs the boundary between indoors and out. In summer, it’s bathed in sunshine with garden scents drifting in; in winter, the underfloor heating beneath the tiled floor keeps it warm and inviting, making it a peaceful place to watch frost settle over the fields. French doors lead directly onto the terrace.
A useful downstairs WC is located off the kitchen lobby.
The garage, also accommodates the washing machine and serves as a practical laundry area, keeping day-to-day chores neatly out of sight.
Upstairs – Four Bedrooms and Countryside Calm
The oak staircase leads to a vaulted landing filled with light from Velux windows, creating an airy welcome to the upper floor.
Bedroom One –
 The main bedroom enjoys far-reaching views from four windows, fitted wardrobes, and a feature oak-slat wall detail. The en-suite includes a double shower with glazed screen, vanity sink with mirror, WC, and marble-effect tiling to walls and floor.
Bedroom Two –
 A spacious double with a front-facing outlook, blue panelled feature wall, and built-in wardrobes.
Bedroom Three –
 Overlooking the side garden, decorated in soft pink to half height with a charming exposed beam behind the bed.
Bedroom Four –
 Currently a nursery, with a sage-painted feature wall and a view over the front.
A Bathroom Designed for Comfort and Style
The family bathroom combines practicality with a sense of luxury. Large marble-effect tiles flow from floor to ceiling, reflecting light beautifully. A wall-hung toilet, contemporary vanity with warm wood countertop, and countertop basin with chrome mixer tap set the scene. An illuminated circular mirror adds soft ambience, complemented by recessed shelving. The bath, with rainfall shower over, invites both quick refreshes and long, indulgent soaks. A chrome heated towel rail and thoughtful design touches complete the space.
Gardens and Outlook
The gardens are a perfect marriage of open space, mature planting, and uninterrupted views. Lawns sweep around the property, bordered by established shrubs, seasonal flowers, and well-tended beds. A paved terrace alongside the conservatory offers a sunny spot for morning coffee or evening drinks, while stone pathways link different seating areas.
A raised planting bed adds colour and structure, and a firepit area provides a cosy place to gather. Climbing plants soften timber and stone boundaries, while hedges offer privacy without interrupting the expansive views. From every vantage point, the rolling hills stretch into the distance – vibrant in summer, golden in autumn, and softly frosted in winter.
In the Village
Edgworth offers a thriving community with everyday essentials and a welcoming atmosphere. Within walking distance, you’ll find a post office, village shop, butcher, two cafes, a hairdresser, and a beautician. The village also boasts a cricket club, 4G football pitches, and the much-loved Holden’s & Co ice cream shop.
For dining, try the new gastropub at The Spread Eagle or the traditional charm of The White Horse and The Black Bull. Nearby Ramsbottom offers an even wider choice of restaurants and bars, just 10 minutes away.
Edgworth Primary School is rated ‘Good’ by Ofsted, with secondary options at Turton School and Canon Slade, both also rated ‘Good’. Buses also run to Bury Grammar and Bolton independent schools.
For outdoor pursuits, the scenic Wayoh and Entwistle reservoirs are close by, along with the village park. Commuters benefit from excellent road links, with the M65 just 15 minutes away, and Bolton or Bury reachable in around 20 minutes.

Exclusivity Fee:
You can secure the purchase today by paying an exclusivity fee of £2,000 which gives you the rights to purchase within a given timeframe. The exclusivity fee is returned to you upon successful completion of the property.
A processing fee of £200 is required in order to draw up an exclusive legally binding contract between the buyer and seller. This gives the buyer exclusive rights to purchase within a pre-agreed timeframe.

This stunning ensuite student room apartment is fully furnished and includes a bed, en-suite with shower and access to a communal kitchen kitchen. It's easy to see why The Pack Horse has proven popular with Bolton's influx of students, offering a fantastic range of on-site facilities including a fully-equipped gym and a modern common room with pool tables, pinball machines, video games and even a large projector screen for movie nights, making it incredibly easy for residents to relax, unwind and socialise. Residents also benefit from secure bicycle storage, CCTV in the communal areas, a concierge reception service and laundry facilities.
The Pack Horse is a beautiful period building that was once the prestigious Pack Horse Hotel, which was transformed in 2012 to create the ultimate boutique student living experience. Located on Bradshawgate, only a 10 minute walk away from the University of Bolton, The Pack Horse has everything that Bolton has to offer on its doorstep! Bradshawgate is home to most of Bolton's bars and restaurants, alongside the recently renovated Market Place shopping centre and the newly opened Vaults which contains numerous restaurants and high street shops. It's no surprise that The Pack Horse is one of the most sought after developments in Bolton!
The University of Bolton has around 14,000 students, with over 8,000 living and travelling from areas outside the North West region. Unlike the close neighbours of Liverpool and Manchester, virtually no Purpose-Built Student Accommodation exists in the immediate area, with a housing problem lagging some way behind the ambitious ongoing development plans of the University of Bolton. Now is the perfect time to invest in Bolton's student accommodation!

Important Notice:
For each Lot, a contract documentation fee of £1,500 (inclusive of VAT) is payable to Barnard Marcus Auctions by the buyer. The seller may charge additional fees payable upon completion. If applicable, such fees are detailed within the Special Conditions of Sale. Buyers are deemed to bid in full knowledge of this.
The Guide Price quoted must not be relied upon by prospective purchasers as a valuation or assessment of value of the property. It is intended to provide purchasers with an indication of the region at which the reserve may be set at the time of going to press. The guide price may be subject to variation and interested parties are advised to make regular checks for variations and should be aware that the reserve price may be either below or above the quoted guide price.
Prospective purchasers should also be aware that the eventual sale price may be above or below the guide level dependent upon competition, and should therefore not presume the guide to be indicative of the final expected sale price or the price the property is available at.
When setting the guide price, the auctioneers have given consideration to the seller’s instructions in respect of their indicated reserve price at the time of instruction. The reserve price, (the level below which the property will not be sold), remains confidential between the seller and the auctioneer. The guide price therefore, is intended to indicate the region at which the reserve price is intended to be set. The seller will confirm their final reserve price close to the auction date and if appropriate the auctioneers may adjust the guide price to reflect this.
Whilst Barnard Marcus make every effort to ensure the safety and security of viewers at properties, we have not carried out a detailed Health & Safety inspection of properties in our auctions and cannot therefore guarantee the safety and security of viewers.
Prospective purchasers and bidders attend properties entirely at their own risk. Particular care should be taken when accessing cellars, attics, exterior grounds and outbuildings and boundaries. All non-conducted inspections of vacant sites should be made in daylight hours only and entry into such sites is entirely at the viewers risk.

3. Photographs and Measurements: Some images may have been taken by a wide angled lens camera. These approximate room sizes are only intended as general guidance. You must verify the dimensions carefully before ordering carpets or any built-in furniture.

• The detached property is constructed of brick under a slate roof and requires a full scheme of modernisations. The accommodation offers good sized and well-proportioned space over 2 floors. On the ground floor are three reception rooms, a kitchen, shower room, and boiler/utility room. Upstairs there are four bedrooms and a bathroom.

• A Planning Application has been approved under Section 19 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 to amend the approved proposals for the conversion of a traditional agricultural building into three residential dwellings (Ref: 106995/lbc/22).
• The original scheme, which was granted with Listed Building Consent, includes the sensitive restoration and conversion of the building into three characterful homes (Use Class C3), along with associated external works, private amenity space, and parking provision. The project also involves the removal of more modern structures on the site, including a steel-framed agricultural building, a shed, and a car port, relocating two of the approved parking spaces to better integrate with the site layout and heritage context, enhancing the landscaping scheme, with additional planting to further soften the development and support local biodiversity
Lot 2 - The Farm Buildings

These facilities are currently in use by a farming tenant under a Farm Business Tenancy, which is set to conclude in September 2025. These are available by separate negotiation.

Welcome to Fairview Avenue, one of Dane Bank’s most sought-after residential streets – where homes rarely come to market. This impressive three-bedroom semi-detached property is a true gem, offering spacious, stylish living with an abundance of charm, curb appeal, and potential.
From the moment you arrive, the home’s exterior makes a lasting impression. The immaculately kept front garden, double driveway, and detached garage with electric set the tone for what lies beyond – a property that’s been lovingly maintained and thoughtfully designed both inside and out.
Step inside to a large and welcoming hallway, providing a warm and elegant entrance. The living room stretches the full length of the house, creating a generous and inviting space for relaxing or entertaining. With a beautiful bay window to the front and French doors opening out to the rear garden, the room is bathed in natural light throughout the day.
Off the hallway, you’ll also find a separate dining room, ideal for formal meals or a flexible second reception space. The modern kitchen is both stylish and practical, offering access to the rear garden and plenty of storage and workspace.
Upstairs, the property continues to impress with three generously sized bedrooms. The primary bedroom, positioned at the front, boasts another elegant bay window and built-in wardrobes, while the second double bedroom, overlooking the garden, also features ample fitted storage. The third bedroom is surprisingly spacious and can accommodate a double bed, though it currently works well as a large single or home office.
A key highlight of the first floor is the expansive family bathroom, complete with both a full-sized bath and a separate shower enclosure, providing comfort and practicality for busy households. The WC is housed separately, a convenient layout for families.
Outside, the beautifully landscaped rear garden offers a peaceful retreat or a vibrant entertaining space. Whether you’re a keen gardener, enjoy outdoor gatherings, or have children who need space to play, this garden ticks all the boxes. The detached garage provides excellent additional storage or workspace potential.
For those seeking future flexibility, the generous plot size offers fantastic scope for extension (subject to planning permission), making this an excellent long-term family home.
Located just a short walk from local shops, amenities, and the stunning Reddish Vale Nature Reserve, this home enjoys a prime position in Dane Bank. With excellent transport links to Manchester, Stockport, and the wider M60 network, and within catchment for well-regarded local schools, the location is ideal for families, professionals, and commuters alike.
Properties on Fairview Avenue are rarely available – don’t miss your chance to make this stunning home your own. Early viewing is highly recommended

Detailed Description
Located on the ever-popular Rectory Road in Garswood, this three-bedroom detached property represents an exceptional opportunity for those with vision, creativity, and a passion for transformation. In need of a full back-to-brick renovation throughout, the home offers endless potential either as a rewarding development project or the foundation for creating a truly bespoke family residence. The generous plot and well-proportioned rooms provide an excellent canvas, with the current ground floor layout comprising a porch, welcoming entrance hall, kitchen, dining room, living room, and a versatile downstairs bedroom. Upstairs, there are two spacious double bedrooms and a bathroom. Outside, the property enjoys gardens to both the front and rear, a driveway providing off-road parking, and a single garage.
Due to the property’s condition, it is unlikely that traditional mortgage finance will be available, and we strongly recommend viewing the virtual tour before arranging a physical visit. Garswood itself is a desirable residential area within Ashton-in-Makerfield, cherished for its close-knit community, well-regarded local schools, and excellent access to open green spaces. For commuters, the location is superb - Garswood Train Station is just moments away, and the M6 motorway is within easy reach, offering swift connections to Liverpool, Manchester, and beyond. This is a rare chance to acquire a property with such scope in one of the area’s most sought-after locations.

A Substantial Four-Bedroom Family Home in a Prestigious Prestwich Location
Set on one of Prestwich’s most desirable residential avenues, this impressive semi-detached home offers space, character and flexibility for modern family living. With four bedrooms, two reception rooms, a separate garage and a prime location close to excellent schools and local amenities, it is the perfect blend of comfort and convenience.
From the moment you step into the welcoming porch and hallway, the generous proportions are immediately apparent. The front lounge is light-filled and elegant, providing the ideal setting for relaxing with family or hosting guests. Two dining spaces offer versatile options – a cosy everyday area adjacent to the kitchen, and a larger, more formal dining room perfect for entertaining. A ground floor cloakroom adds further practicality to the layout.
Upstairs, the home’s four bedrooms offer a variety of uses. Two are substantial enough to serve as the principal bedroom, while the remaining rooms are well-suited for guests, children or a dedicated home office. The family bathroom is centrally located to serve all rooms with ease.
The property also benefits from a separate garage, ideal for secure parking or additional storage, and sits within a mature residential setting renowned for its peaceful atmosphere and strong community spirit.
Prestwich is a vibrant and highly sought-after area of Greater Manchester, known for its tree-lined streets, excellent schooling and an array of independent shops, cafes and restaurants. Local parks and green spaces are within easy reach, and excellent transport links – including nearby rail connections – ensure Manchester city centre is just a short journey away.
This is a rare opportunity to secure a substantial home in an outstanding location, offering both the space and the lifestyle that many buyers are seeking.

This detached bungalow, once three bedrooms and now converted into a two-bedroom layout by extending the lounge, offers a fantastic opportunity for anyone looking to put their own stamp on a property.

The two double bedrooms both have fitted wardrobes, and the large lounge—created by extending into what was previously a third bedroom—offers an impressive main living area with plenty of natural light.
Outside, the bungalow benefits from a gated driveway to the rear, which is typically used as the main entrance, and this leads directly onto the main road. There’s also a shed for storage, and the garden offers plenty of scope for landscaping to your taste.
With its generous plot, flexible layout, and desirable location, this property is ideal for those seeking a renovation project with real potential.
