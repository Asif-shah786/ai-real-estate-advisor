Just a short stroll from a range of village amenities and glorious countryside walks, it’s a home that offers the very best of both worlds — heritage charm and modern practicality.\nSpanning three floors, the generous accommodation includes a spacious entrance hallway, large open-plan kitchen and dining room flowing onto the garden, two further substantial reception rooms, utility, downstairs WC, five bedrooms, two bathrooms and a storeroom. Outside, a private driveway, secluded sunny rear garden, and a versatile detached garden room complete the package.\nPeriod Character &amp; Charm\nFrom the moment you step through the original oak front door, the home’s heritage is evident. The hallway retains beautiful oak panelling and staircase, enhanced by statement tiled flooring. Period features continue throughout, from picture rails to open fires with cast iron surrounds, all set against a premium Farrow &amp; Ball colour palette. The current owners have done a superb job of preserving this charm while subtly upgrading the property to meet modern living standards.\nOpen-Plan Living\nThe showpiece of this home is the stunning open-plan kitchen and dining space created by the recent extension. A soaring vaulted ceiling, skylights, and French doors fill the room with natural light and create a seamless connection to the garden — ideal for relaxed summer living and entertaining.\nThe walnut breakfast bar invites Sunday brunches, while the quartz worktops and minimalist cabinetry keep the look sleek and timeless. A suite of Neff integrated appliances includes a dishwasher, oven and combination oven, five-zone induction hob with extractor, plus full-height fridge and freezer.

The rear room opens onto the patio, making a wonderful summer lounge, while the bay-fronted room to the front is perfect for cosy winter evenings by the fire. Both feature traditional chimney breasts and open fireplaces, keeping the home’s character alive.\nPractical Spaces\nThe utility room mirrors the kitchen’s modern styling, with extra worktops, storage, and plumbing for laundry appliances. An external door makes it ideal as a secondary entrance for muddy boots and dogs.\nBedrooms &amp; Bathrooms\nAcross the first and second floors are five well-proportioned bedrooms, four of which are generous doubles. The fifth, currently used as a home office, enjoys far-reaching views towards Manchester.\nOn the first floor, the front bedroom boasts a charming mullion window, while the rear enjoys a bay with green garden views. The family bathroom is equally impressive, with a freestanding bath, walk-in shower, basin, and WC set against coordinating wall and floor tiles.\nThe second floor is perfect for a teenager or guest suite, with a spacious double bedroom under sloped ceilings and skylights, plus an adjacent shower room with a modern three-piece suite.\nOutside Space\nTo the front, a large driveway with EV charging point is framed by mature planting, giving excellent kerb appeal. The south-westerly rear garden is a true suntrap from midday to evening, with two patios — one for al-fresco dining, the other for lounging — plus a central lawn, mature borders, and fruit and vegetable planters for green-fingered buyers.\nThe detached garden studio, complete with power, lighting, and hot/cold water, is an adaptable space for a home office, gym, bar, or hobby room.\nLocation\nHolcombe Brook is one of Ramsbottom’s most desirable areas, offering a warm village feel with the convenience of excellent local amenities.

Recently upgraded with a brand-new kitchen and new roof in 2024, it combines modern comfort with stunning panoramic views over open countryside. Perfectly suited for family life, the layout includes a welcoming entrance hall, full-depth living room, spacious open-plan kitchen/dining room, home office, conservatory/utility, three bedrooms, and a family bathroom. Outside, the garage and under-garage basement provide exceptional storage, while the south-westerly garden captures the sun all afternoon through to spectacular sunsets.\nLiving Space\nStep inside to a generous entrance hall with plenty of space for coats, shoes, and everyday essentials, keeping the rest of the home clutter-free.\nOn the upper ground floor, the full-length living room offers a rare sense of scale, with large windows at both ends filling the room with natural light. From the rear, the window perfectly frames those breathtaking countryside views. The space is styled with a contemporary finish, complemented by a traditional chimney breast, oak mantel, and decorative inlet for added charm.\nAlso on this level, a dedicated home office/study provides a quiet corner to work or focus, away from the busier heart of the home.\nOn the lower ground floor, the impressive open-plan kitchen and dining room is the social hub, complete with underfloor heating for year-round comfort. The kitchen’s timeless yet modern design features integrated appliances, including a double oven, microwave, fridge-freezer, dishwasher, and a four-ring hob with concealed extractor. The breakfast bar seats four, while the spacious dining area is perfect for family meals and entertaining guests. The room flows into the conservatory/utility, leading directly out to the garden for easy indoor-outdoor living.\nBedrooms &amp; Bathroom\nUpstairs, three well-proportioned bedrooms make the most of the home’s elevated position, with the rear bedrooms enjoying those same incredible scenic views. The family bathroom offers a blank canvas for a modern update to your own taste and style.\nOutside Space\nTo the front, a private drive and garage provide easy parking, with the garage basement adding valuable extra storage.\nThe rear garden is a great highlight, south-westerly facing to catch the sun from midday until evening, with a raised decking area for relaxing, dining, and entertaining against the backdrop of breathtaking sunsets over Winter Hill. Below, the lawn offers space for children to play or for green-fingered owners to create their ideal garden retreat.\nLocation\nDespite the peaceful, elevated setting, you’re just moments from the heart of Egerton village and only a short drive to Bromley Cross. Both offer an excellent choice of pubs, restaurants, shops, and highly regarded schools and nurseries.\nFor outdoor lovers, the surrounding countryside, reservoirs, and West Pennine Moors provide endless opportunities for walking, cycling, running, and sailing.\nCommuters benefit from quick access to the A666 for motorway connections, while Bromley Cross Train Station — around five minutes’ drive — offers direct services into central Manchester.\nKey Details\nTax band: C\nTenure: Leasehold\nGround rent: £14 per annum\nLease term: 1000 years from 1969\nHeating: Gas boiler and radiators\nBoiler: Worcester combi, installed in 2024\nLoft: Insulated and boarded with a pull-down ladder installed\nRead\n full description\nIn partnership with\nZoopla insights\nSign in and gain expert analysis to make informed decisions.\nStamp duty calculator\nOur instant calculator helps you understand how much stamp duty is due on property purchases in England &amp; Northern Ireland.\n\nRead the latest stamp duty news\nPrice\nYour situation\nPlease select\nBuying for the first time\nHome mover with one property\nBuying an additional property\nFrom 1st April 2025\n\n£-\nThis calculation is intended as a guide only.

    "about_property": "The Pump House is an impressive fusion of contemporary architecture, luxury family living, and peaceful sanctuary — all wrapped in over 7,000 sq ft of exceptional space and nestled within 4.5 acres of private grounds. Elevated above a tranquil wooded valley with landscaped gardens cascading down to the river below, this magnificent home offers unrivalled privacy, awe-inspiring design, and a standard of living that must be seen to be fully appreciated.\nFrom the tree-lined driveway and bold architectural form to the exquisite interiors, bedroom suites, designer kitchen, multiple reception rooms, home cinema, indoor swimming pool and home gym — this is family life at its most refined. Located just moments from the amenities of Standish village, acclaimed schools, and key transport links, The Pump House is a home that delivers the very best of both worlds.\nAn Impressive Approach\nThe house is so discreetly positioned that if nobody told you it was here, you’d never know it existed. Accessed via electric gates, a tree-lined driveway opens to landscaped grounds and reveals the home in all its grandeur — perfectly framed by lush greenery and manicured lawns.\nThe main parking area is large enough for a whole fleet of cars, and the home welcomes you inside through a supersize bespoke solid oak door with glass surrounds, giving you the first impression of the grand proportions found throughout. A handy porch leads through to the central reception hall where you immediately notice the stylish oak and glass staircase, plus the abundance of natural light pouring in through the huge skylight window and glass wall at the rear.\nThe Designer Kitchen\nThe heart of the home is the exceptional designer kitchen and daily dining area — a breathtaking space with plentiful glass and panoramic views of the gardens and valley below. Bifold doors and three sets of French doors open onto a vast elevated composite deck, creating seamless indoor-outdoor living.\nDesigned and installed by the renowned Stuart Frazer, this premium Siematic kitchen features minimalist cabinetry, ambient recessed lighting, and deep Corian worktops. Every detail has been considered — from the walk-in pantry to the well-tailored storage and integral larder cabinets.\nA selection of Miele appliances includes two conventional ovens with warming drawers, a microwave, steam oven, full-length fridge and dishwasher. Additional highlights include a Bora induction hob with built-in downdraft extractor, a Quooker tap with instant boiling, chilled and sparkling water, a Liebherr full-length freezer, and twin Monogram wine fridges.\nAt the centre is an enormous island with a contrasting dark oak breakfast bar — a stunning and practical hub for everyday family life, relaxed weekends, or entertaining. Whether it's Sunday brunch, evening drinks with friends, or summer barbecues spilling out onto the decking, this space is made to be enjoyed.\nReception Rooms\nThe Pump House offers four distinct reception rooms, each delivering space, comfort, and flexibility for the modern family.\nThe main lounge is a showstopper — around 33 sq m in size, with a vaulted double-height ceiling, six-panel bifold doors, and a stylish glass inset log burner within a towering chimney breast and gallery landing above. It’s a room made for hosting on a grand scale or unwinding in total comfort.\nNext door, the media room offers another luxurious lounge experience, with floor-to-ceiling windows by day and a full cinema set-up by night — blackout blinds, projector screen, and surround sound at the touch of a button. It’s ideal as a cinema, games room or teenage retreat.\nOn the opposite side of the reception hall, the formal dining room enjoys an abundance of natural light, with French doors opening onto a covered al-fresco dining terrace. Perfect for dinner parties and special occasions, it blends elegance with atmosphere.\nAdjoining the kitchen is a peaceful day lounge — currently a relaxed sitting room with more French doors onto the garden. It’s the perfect spot for morning coffee, a children's playroom, or a snug for reading and relaxation.\nPractical Aspects\nFunctionality is fully considered, with a separate plant room, utility, guest WC, ample cloak storage, and a large, fully equipped home office designed for two people. A unique bonus is the first-floor laundry room — located near the bedrooms and complete with plumbing, sink, and generous storage.\nBedrooms &amp; Bathrooms\nThe entire first floor benefits from vaulted ceilings and striking architectural lines. Full-height apex windows and walls of glass frame tranquil green views from every room.\nEach of the five double bedrooms has its own sleek three-piece en-suite with tiled surrounds and modern fittings, all immaculately maintained. The master suite adds a walk-in dressing room and a stunning private balcony beneath an apex roof — your own peaceful morning sanctuary just steps from the bed.\nLeisure Facilities\nThe indoor swimming pool is a standout feature, newly refurbished and upgraded with a Calorex system in 2025. Enjoy year-round heated swimming with a swim-jet system for endless laps, plus a hot tub, skylights, floor-to-ceiling windows, and bifold doors connecting you back to the neighbouring nature.\nAccessed via a covered walkway from the house and also from the first floor via a spiral staircase, it’s a true private spa experience. A home gym links the gallery landing to the pool hall — equally suited to yoga or conversion into a wellness suite or sauna.\nA Luxury Finish\nFrom the moment you enter, the luxury is unmistakable — bespoke oak joinery and flooring, natural stone tiling, gallery landings, vast proportions, and world-class appliances throughout.\nA Control4 smart home system allows you to manage lighting, heating, and audio from your phone, delivering comfort and convenience with every touch.\nGardens, Grounds &amp; Garages\nSet on approximately 4.5 acres with no neighbours in sight, this is more than a home — it's a countryside retreat. The gated driveway delivers complete seclusion and leads to a shale-surfaced parking area, triple garage, and carport with EV charging point.\nTo the rear, a full-width composite deck with glass balustrades offers a breath-taking entertaining space overlooking the valley and river. It’s piled into the ground for structural integrity and generously sized to accommodate sun loungers, dining zones, or even an outdoor kitchen if desired.\nThe surrounding grounds include manicured lawns, landscaped borders, rockeries, and mature trees. To one side, Japanese-inspired tiered lawns step down to a large wildlife pond, offering a magical connection to the river and nature. A children’s treehouse completes the picture — making this a truly special home for every generation.\nLocation\nDespite its extraordinary privacy, The Pump House is just moments from the bustling and sought-after village of Standish — home to a wide selection of independent shops, cafes, restaurants, gyms, supermarkets, and top-rated schools.\nThe M6 motorway is a short drive away, placing Manchester, Preston, and the wider North West within easy commuting distance. This rare combination of peace, privacy, and connectivity makes the location just as impressive as the home itself.\nSpecific Details\nCouncil Tax Band: H\nTenure: Freehold\nHeating: Gas boiler and tank with water-based underfloor heating throughout\nDrainage: Private septic tank\nUtilities: Mains gas, electricity, and water\nSecurity: Full alarm system with CCTV\nSmart Home: Control4 automation system\nRead\n full description\nIn partnership with\nZoopla insights\nSign in and gain expert analysis to make informed decisions.\nStamp duty calculator\nOur instant calculator helps you understand how much stamp duty is due on property purchases in England &amp; Northern Ireland.\n\nRead the latest stamp duty news\nPrice\nYour situation\nPlease select\nBuying for the first time\nHome mover with one property\nBuying an additional property\nFrom 1st April 2025\n\n£-\nThis calculation is intended as a guide only.

The ground floor comprises generously sized rooms: A large open plan living dining kitchen, formal living room, dining room, executive study and utility boot room.

The bedroom has the benefit of a lovely sit on balcony overlooking the gardens below.

Please note that we have not tested any apparatus, equipment, fixtures, fittings or services including gas central heating and so cannot verify they are in working order or fit for their purpose. Furthermore, Solicitors should confirm movable items described in the sales particulars and, in fact, included in the sale since circumstances do change during the marketing or negotiations. Although we try to ensure accuracy, if measurements are used in this listing, they may be approximate.

The cost of these checks is £65 (incl. VAT), which covers the cost of obtaining relevant data and any manual checks and monitoring which might be required.

Framed by open countryside, its glass-roofed conservatory captures sweeping views across rolling fields, while the gardens – a blend of manicured lawns, vibrant borders, and stone pathways – offer peaceful corners to pause and take in the surroundings.\nThe approach sets the scene. A gentle climb along a farm track, edged with open green fields and drystone walls, draws you deeper into rural life. Passing through the working farmyard, the air carries the scent of hay and the occasional sound of livestock, a reminder of the home’s agricultural setting. Beyond the old stone gateposts and cattle grid, the paved driveway and integral double garage mark your arrival at this welcoming home.\nWhere Character Meets Comfort\nStep inside the covered portico entrance into a bright, contemporary hallway, complete with a handy cloakroom cupboard and direct access to the garage. The warmth of the timber front door, the herringbone flooring, and the overall light and airy feel immediately set the tone – this is a home that respects its heritage while embracing a stylish, modern finish.\nA Lounge for All Seasons\nTo the left lies the award-winning, magazine-featured lounge – a showpiece of style and comfort. A rustic double-sided stone fireplace with wood-burning stove anchors one wall, adding warmth and character. Soft recessed lighting casts a gentle glow over white walls, oak doors, and the stone-flagged floor that flows throughout the ground floor. Generous picture windows frame the surrounding greenery, creating a connection with the outdoors, while the spacious layout offers the flexibility for cosy evenings or larger gatherings. Integrated ceiling speakers in both the lounge and the kitchen enhance everyday living and entertaining, offering seamless, high-quality audio throughout the social heart of the home\nDining with a Sense of Occasion\nThe dining room is full of character, with flagstone flooring under centuries-old oak beams. The double-sided fireplace forms a striking focal point, perfect for lingering over candlelit dinners. A wide picture window overlooks the garden, bringing the changing seasons into every mealtime. Above, the double-height section reveals the oak staircase, complete with cleverly integrated storage beneath, linking the two floors with light and openness.\nThe Heart of the Home – Kitchen &amp; Conservatory\nThe kitchen/breakfast room is designed to be both functional and inviting. Soft grey cabinetry with brushed brass handles pairs with warm wood worktops, while a range-style cooker sits beneath a concealed extractor, framed by rustic herringbone tiling. Integrated appliances include an oven, microwave, fridge, freezer, dishwasher, wine cooler, and a farmhouse-style sink perfectly placed beneath a window to take in the countryside views.\nA breakfast bar seating four creates the ideal spot for casual dining, morning coffee, or catching up with friends. From here, a door opens to the conservatory – a light-filled space with glass walls and a vaulted roof that blurs the boundary between indoors and out. In summer, it’s bathed in sunshine with garden scents drifting in; in winter, the underfloor heating beneath the tiled floor keeps it warm and inviting, making it a peaceful place to watch frost settle over the fields. French doors lead directly onto the terrace.\nA useful downstairs WC is located off the kitchen lobby.\nThe garage, also accommodates the washing machine and serves as a practical laundry area, keeping day-to-day chores neatly out of sight.\nUpstairs – Four Bedrooms and Countryside Calm\nThe oak staircase leads to a vaulted landing filled with light from Velux windows, creating an airy welcome to the upper floor.\nBedroom One –\n The main bedroom enjoys far-reaching views from four windows, fitted wardrobes, and a feature oak-slat wall detail. The en-suite includes a double shower with glazed screen, vanity sink with mirror, WC, and marble-effect tiling to walls and floor.\nBedroom Two –\n A spacious double with a front-facing outlook, blue panelled feature wall, and built-in wardrobes.\nBedroom Three –\n Overlooking the side garden, decorated in soft pink to half height with a charming exposed beam behind the bed.\nBedroom Four –\n Currently a nursery, with a sage-painted feature wall and a view over the front.\nA Bathroom Designed for Comfort and Style\nThe family bathroom combines practicality with a sense of luxury. Large marble-effect tiles flow from floor to ceiling, reflecting light beautifully. A wall-hung toilet, contemporary vanity with warm wood countertop, and countertop basin with chrome mixer tap set the scene. An illuminated circular mirror adds soft ambience, complemented by recessed shelving. The bath, with rainfall shower over, invites both quick refreshes and long, indulgent soaks. A chrome heated towel rail and thoughtful design touches complete the space.\nGardens and Outlook\nThe gardens are a perfect marriage of open space, mature planting, and uninterrupted views. Lawns sweep around the property, bordered by established shrubs, seasonal flowers, and well-tended beds. A paved terrace alongside the conservatory offers a sunny spot for morning coffee or evening drinks, while stone pathways link different seating areas.\nA raised planting bed adds colour and structure, and a firepit area provides a cosy place to gather. Climbing plants soften timber and stone boundaries, while hedges offer privacy without interrupting the expansive views. From every vantage point, the rolling hills stretch into the distance – vibrant in summer, golden in autumn, and softly frosted in winter.\nIn the Village\nEdgworth offers a thriving community with everyday essentials and a welcoming atmosphere. Within walking distance, you’ll find a post office, village shop, butcher, two cafes, a hairdresser, and a beautician. The village also boasts a cricket club, 4G football pitches, and the much-loved Holden’s &amp; Co ice cream shop.\nFor dining, try the new gastropub at The Spread Eagle or the traditional charm of The White Horse and The Black Bull. Nearby Ramsbottom offers an even wider choice of restaurants and bars, just 10 minutes away.\nEdgworth Primary School is rated ‘Good’ by Ofsted, with secondary options at Turton School and Canon Slade, both also rated ‘Good’. Buses also run to Bury Grammar and Bolton independent schools.\nFor outdoor pursuits, the scenic Wayoh and Entwistle reservoirs are close by, along with the village park. Commuters benefit from excellent road links, with the M65 just 15 minutes away, and Bolton or Bury reachable in around 20 minutes.\nImportant Notice for Buyers\nWe do our best to make sure our property details are accurate and reliable, but they do not form part of any offer or contract and should not be relied upon as statements of fact.

It is intended to provide purchasers with an indication of the region at which the reserve may be set at the time of going to press. The guide price may be subject to variation and interested parties are advised to make regular checks for variations and should be aware that the reserve price may be either below or above the quoted guide price.\nProspective purchasers should also be aware that the eventual sale price may be above or below the guide level dependent upon competition, and should therefore not presume the guide to be indicative of the final expected sale price or the price the property is available at.\nWhen setting the guide price, the auctioneers have given consideration to the seller’s instructions in respect of their indicated reserve price at the time of instruction. The reserve price, (the level below which the property will not be sold), remains confidential between the seller and the auctioneer. The guide price therefore, is intended to indicate the region at which the reserve price is intended to be set. The seller will confirm their final reserve price close to the auction date and if appropriate the auctioneers may adjust the guide price to reflect this.\nWhilst Barnard Marcus make every effort to ensure the safety and security of viewers at properties, we have not carried out a detailed Health &amp; Safety inspection of properties in our auctions and cannot therefore guarantee the safety and security of viewers.\nProspective purchasers and bidders attend properties entirely at their own risk.

The project also involves the removal of more modern structures on the site, including a steel-framed agricultural building, a shed, and a car port, relocating two of the approved parking spaces to better integrate with the site layout and heritage context, enhancing the landscaping scheme, with additional planting to further soften the development and support local biodiversity\nLot 2 - The Farm Buildings\n• Complementing the traditional features of the property is a range of modern agricultural buildings positioned alongside a slurry lagoon and well-constructed silage clamps.
