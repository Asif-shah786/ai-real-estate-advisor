Chapter 1: Introduction 

1.1 Background and Motivation 

Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly transformed the way information is accessed, processed, and consumed across industries. Within the field of natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, enabling systems that can converse, summarize, and reason in natural language (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2024). A key advancement in making these systems practical for specialized domains is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which couples LLMs with domain-specific knowledge bases to ensure factual accuracy, transparency, and trustworthiness (Lewis et al., 2020). 

The UK property sector represents a domain where such technologies can deliver tangible value. Housing transactions remain a cornerstone of the economy, with over 1.2 million sales registered in 2022 (HM Land Registry, 2023). Yet, buyers, tenants, and investors often face significant friction when seeking reliable and comprehensive information. Property portals such as Rightmove and Zoopla provide listings but do not support conversational exploration or contextual follow-ups. Users are forced to rely on filters and keyword search, which can be unintuitive and insufficient for nuanced queries such as: 

"Show me two bedroom flats in Manchester under £200,000"
"Does the first one have any schools nearby?" 
"What are crime rates in this area?"
"Show me properties in Salford with stations nearby"

Such queries require not only retrieval from structured data, but also the ability to handle contextual reference ("the first one") and entity resolution across conversational turns—features absent from current property search platforms. The complexity is further compounded by the need to integrate multiple data sources including property listings, crime statistics, school ratings, transport links, and legal regulations.

Greater Manchester provides a compelling regional focus for this work. Home to over 2.8 million residents and a diverse housing stock, it is one of the UK's most active property markets (ONS, 2023). The area combines high rental yields in student-heavy districts with ongoing regeneration in urban centers, presenting a variety of property search needs. By designing an AI assistant focused on this geography, the project addresses both an academic challenge (integrating RAG with structured, domain-specific data) and a practical need (improving transparency and accessibility for users in a real housing market).

From a user perspective, the motivation extends beyond efficiency. Property purchase or rental is a stressful, high-stakes decision; confusion about auctions, council tax, or leasehold restrictions can delay or derail transactions. For estate agents, providing instant, conversational answers enhances customer service and differentiates them in a competitive digital market (PropTech UK, 2022). This project therefore situates itself at the intersection of technical innovation, regulatory compliance, and human-centered design. 

1.2 Problem Statement and Research Gap 

Although vast amounts of property data are available online, several persistent problems remain: 

**Fragmentation of data** – Property listings, schools, transport, crime statistics, and legal regulations are distributed across multiple sources, requiring manual integration by the user. Current systems lack the capability to synthesize information from disparate datasets into coherent, actionable insights.

**Limited interaction modes** – Portals offer filter-based search but cannot interpret free-form or conversational queries. Users cannot ask natural language questions such as "What are the safest areas for families with children?" or "Show me investment properties with good transport links."

**Lack of contextual follow-up** – Current systems cannot resolve conversational references such as "that one" or "the second property." This limitation prevents natural, multi-turn conversations that mirror human interaction patterns.

**Transparency concerns** – Information is often incomplete, and explanations about legal or financial aspects are absent. Users cannot verify the source of information or understand the reasoning behind recommendations.

**Inadequate semantic understanding** – Traditional search relies on keyword matching rather than understanding user intent and context, leading to poor recall and precision for complex queries.

Academic and industry literature reveals substantial research on RAG for domains such as biomedical knowledge (Gao et al., 2022) and customer support (Karpukhin et al., 2020), but there is little work applying these techniques to real estate. Studies of conversational recommender systems in housing have typically focused on recommendation models (Zhang et al., 2021), rather than retrieval-grounded, multi-turn conversational assistants. Moreover, compliance with UK GDPR and the ethical use of AI in high-value consumer decisions remain underexplored in this domain (ICO, 2023). 

The research gap therefore lies in: the absence of a domain-specific, GDPR-compliant, retrieval-augmented conversational system tailored to the UK real estate sector, capable of integrating structured property data with modern LLMs to provide context-aware, factual advice through advanced chunking strategies and conversational memory.

1.3 Research Aim and Objectives 

The overall aim of this dissertation is: 

To design, implement, and evaluate a text-based AI real estate advisor for Greater Manchester using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs), capable of delivering accurate, transparent, and context-aware responses to property-related queries through advanced aspect-based chunking and conversational memory systems.

1.4 Research Questions 

The project is guided by the following research questions (RQs): 

**RQ1**: How can heterogeneous property datasets be preprocessed using aspect-based chunking strategies to support both structured queries and embedding-based retrieval in a RAG pipeline?

**RQ2**: What chunking strategies (aspect-based, property-based, semantic) best optimize accuracy and efficiency for property-related queries, and how do they perform across different content types?

**RQ3**: How can conversational memory and history-aware retrieval improve user experience in multi-turn real estate dialogues, particularly for pronoun resolution and contextual follow-ups?

**RQ4**: What metrics best capture factual accuracy, relevancy, and retrieval quality in RAG-powered chatbots, and how do they correlate with user trust and satisfaction?
 
**RQ5**: How can GDPR compliance and ethical principles be operationalized in conversational AI systems for real estate, particularly regarding data transparency and source citation?
